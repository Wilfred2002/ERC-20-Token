# WillToken

WillToken is an ERC20 token deployed on the Sepolia test network. Only for educational purposes.

## What I Learned from This Project

### Understanding the basics of ERC20 tokens

- **Token Functions and Events:** I learned about the key functions and events that comprise the ERC20 standard, such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`, and events like `Transfer` and `Approval`.

### Token Minting

- **Mint Functionality:** I used a `mint` function to create new 1,000,000,000 tokens.
- **Access Control:** I learned about the significance of restricting access to the mint function, ensuring only authorized accounts (like the contract owner) can mint new tokens.

### Allowance Mechanism

- **Delegated Transfers:** I used  the allowance mechanism, which allows an account to authorize another account to spend tokens on its behalf using `approve`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance` functions.
- **Security Considerations:** I recognized the importance of checking and updating allowances securely to prevent potential vulnerabilities.


### Development

- **Deploying Smart Contracts:** I gained hands-on experience deploying my smart contract on a local Ethereum network and testing its functionality.
- **Interacting with Smart Contracts:** I learned how to interact with my deployed contract using remix.ethereum.org! 

## Conclusion

Working on the WillToken helped me gain an introduction into the world of blockchain and I want to build more projects like a wallet on the test network.
